### Overview
* **Duration:** February - March 2021 (5 weeks)
* **Team Size:** Solo project
* **Role:** Product Designer (100%), Web Developer (100%), Server Developer (100%)

A comprehensive web-based gaming platform featuring three classic games: Tetris, Minesweeper, and Bulls and Cows (Number Baseball). The platform includes dedicated forums for each game where users can share strategies and showcase their rankings.

* **Community Engagement:** Game-specific forums for strategy sharing and discussion
* **Competitive Elements:** Leaderboards and ranking systems for each game
* **User Management:** Registration, authentication, and personalized profile pages

### Technical Stack

  * jQuery for DOM manipulation
  * Ajax for asynchronous data handling
  * Bootstrap for responsive design
* **Backend:** 
  * Ubuntu server environment
  * Apache web server
  * PHP for server-side logic
  * PHPMailer for notification functionality
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git

### Key Achievements
