### Overview
* **Duration:** October 2021 (5 weeks)
* **Team Size:** Solo project
* **Role:** Product Designer (100%), Android Developer (100%), Server Developer (100%)

A comprehensive social networking service designed for saving and sharing web links in a post format. The platform enables users to bookmark content from other users and engage in direct one-to-one messaging.

### Development Context
This project, my second full-stack development endeavor, was conceived to address the personal frustration of recording links across multiple locations. The application provides a centralized solution for storing, organizing, and sharing valuable web resources.

Through building a custom chat server and implementing it within the Android environment, I significantly deepened my understanding of TCP/IP networking principles and Android-specific components such as Services and Broadcast Receivers.

A distinctive feature of the application is its implementation of OpenGraph metadata extraction, which provides users with rich visual previews of shared links, enhancing content recognition and user experience.

While the final product represents a scaled-down version of my initial vision due to time constraints, it remains a project I'm passionate about continuing to develop and expand.
